# Getting Started

We are here... Now you can start your vite project without any config.

## Requirement

You should have properly set up a React app with a valid `package.json` file. Otherwise, uninstall this extension.

## Usage

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`).
2. Type `Vite Serve: Start Vite Server` and select it.
3. Wait for dependencies to install.
4. Enjoy :)
